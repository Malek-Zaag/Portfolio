# Gnutella Project 

## Overview :

This project was issued to me during my academic studies. It consists of creating a simple application that uses the peer-to-peer protocol Gnutella.

## Gnutella : 
The Gnutella protocol is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol that allows users to share files directly with each other over the Internet without the need for a central server. It was developed in 2000 and is based on a decentralized network architecture that enables users to search for and download files from other users' computers.

## Implementation :

For implementing the application, i used tkinter for the graphical interface and sockets for communication between different clients, you can find all the code in the github repo down below.
