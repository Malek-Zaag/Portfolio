      <description>Gnutella Project Overview : This project was issued to me during my academic studies. It consists of creating a simple application that uses the peer-to-peer protocol Gnutella.
Gnutella : The Gnutella protocol is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol that allows users to share files directly with each other over the Internet without the need for a central server. It was developed in 2000 and is based on a decentralized network architecture that enables users to search for and download files from other users&amp;rsquo; computers.</description>
